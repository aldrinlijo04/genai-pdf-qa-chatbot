## Development of a PDF-Based Question-Answering Chatbot Using LangChain

### AIM:
To design and implement a question-answering chatbot capable of processing and extracting information from a provided PDF document using LangChain, and to evaluate its effectiveness by testing its responses to diverse queries derived from the document's content.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:

In many cases, users need specific information from large documents without manually searching through them. A question-answering chatbot can address this problem by:

1. Parsing and indexing the content of a PDF document.
2. Allowing users to ask questions in natural language.
3. Providing concise and accurate answers based on the content of the document.
  
The implementation will evaluate the chatbotâ€™s ability to handle diverse queries and deliver accurate responses.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1: Load and Parse PDF
Use LangChain's DocumentLoader to extract text from a PDF document.

#### STEP 2: Create a Vector Store
Convert the text into vector embeddings using a language model, enabling semantic search.

#### STEP 3: Initialize the LangChain QA Pipeline
Use LangChain's RetrievalQA to connect the vector store with a language model for answering questions.

#### STEP 4: Handle User Queries
Process user queries, retrieve relevant document sections, and generate responses.

#### STEP 5: Evaluate Effectiveness
Test the chatbot with a variety of queries to assess accuracy and reliability.

    Function to load postpartum-specific documents and create a conversational retrieval chain.

    Args:
        file (str): Path to the postpartum-related PDF.
        chain_type (str): Type of retrieval chain.
        k (int): Number of retrieved documents.
        llm_name (str): OpenAI model name (e.g., "gpt-4").

    # Step 1: Load postpartum documents
    loader = PyPDFLoader(file)
    documents = loader.load()

    # Step 2: Split documents into manageable chunks
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=150)
    docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

    # Step 3: Define embeddings for postpartum content
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

    # Step 4: Create vector database for document search
    db = DocArrayInMemorySearch.from_documents(docs, embeddings)

    # Step 5: Configure the retriever
    retriever = db.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": k})

    # Step 6: Create a conversational retrieval chain for postpartum topics
    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model_name=llm_name, temperature=0.5),  # Empathetic response style
        chain_type=chain_type,
        retriever=retriever,
        return_source_documents=True,
        return_generated_question=True,
    )
    return qa

### RESULT:
Thus, a question-answering chatbot capable of processing and extracting information from a provided PDF document using LangChain was implemented and evaluated for its effectiveness by testing its responses to diverse queries derived from the document's content successfully.
